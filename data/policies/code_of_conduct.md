# Code of Conduct

## Scope

This Code of Conduct outlines the standards of behavior expected of all employees, contractors, and representatives of the organization. It ensures a respectful, inclusive, and professional workplace. This policy applies globally and supplements—but does not replace—legal and regulatory requirements. All employees must acknowledge this policy; contractors and third parties are expected to adhere when acting on the company's behalf. Related policies include the **Harassment Prevention and Complaint Procedure**, **Confidentiality and NDA Policy**, and **Acceptable Use Policy**; violations of those may also constitute Code of Conduct violations.

## Definitions

- **Integrity**: Acting honestly, transparently, and consistently with our values.
- **Retaliation**: Adverse action against an individual for reporting concerns, participating in an investigation, or opposing conduct that violates policy or law.
- **Good faith**: Making a report or participating in an investigation honestly, even if the report is later determined to be unfounded.

## Core Values

- **Integrity**: Act honestly and transparently in all business dealings. Do not misrepresent facts, hide conflicts of interest, or engage in deceptive practices.
- **Respect**: Treat everyone with dignity, regardless of role, background, identity, or perspective. Foster an inclusive environment.
- **Accountability**: Take responsibility for your actions and their outcomes. Acknowledge mistakes and work to correct them.
- **Collaboration**: Work constructively with colleagues to achieve shared goals. Share credit, give feedback constructively, and support team success.
- **Excellence**: Strive for high quality in your work and continuous improvement. Deliver on commitments and meet professional standards.

## Professional Conduct

- **Communication**: Communicate professionally in writing, speech, and conduct. Use respectful language; avoid gossip, disparagement, or offensive comments.
- **Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts through constructive dialogue. Escalate to your manager or HR when appropriate.
- **Boundaries**: Maintain appropriate boundaries between personal and professional life. Avoid conduct that could create a conflict of interest or appear inappropriate.
- **Harassment and discrimination**: Do not engage in behavior that could reasonably be seen as harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. See the **Harassment Prevention and Complaint Procedure** for definitions and reporting.
- **Confidentiality**: Protect confidential information and respect intellectual property. See the **Confidentiality and NDA Policy**.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure that records, reports, and communications are accurate and complete. Do not falsify documents or data.

## Conflicts of Interest

- Disclose any personal, financial, or other interest that could conflict with your duties.
- Do not use your position for personal gain at the company's expense.
- Avoid outside activities that could impair your judgment or create a conflict. When in doubt, disclose to HR or your manager.

## Reporting Violations

- Report suspected violations to your manager, HR, the Ethics Hotline, or any member of leadership.
- Reports may be made anonymously where permitted by law. Anonymous reporters should provide enough detail to allow investigation.
- Retaliation against individuals who report in good faith is prohibited. Anyone who retaliates will be subject to disciplinary action.
- Investigations will be conducted promptly, fairly, and as confidentially as possible. Need-to-know disclosure may occur as necessary.

## Procedures

### How to Report

1. Contact your manager, HR, or the Ethics Hotline.
2. Provide as much detail as possible: what occurred, when, where, who was involved, and any witnesses.
3. Preserve any relevant documents or communications.
4. Cooperate with the investigation if asked.

### Investigation and Resolution

- Reports are taken seriously and investigated promptly.
- Both the reporting party and the subject of the report may be interviewed. Findings are documented.
- Corrective action is taken when violations are substantiated. Remedies may include training, coaching, warning, change of assignment, suspension, or termination.
- The reporting party may be notified that the matter was addressed, subject to privacy and confidentiality constraints.

## Examples

**Example 1 - Appropriate**: An employee disagrees with a colleague in a meeting. They express their view respectfully, listen to the response, and work toward a solution. This is professional conduct.

**Example 2 - Violation**: An employee makes derogatory comments about a coworker's background in front of others. This violates respect and may constitute harassment. It should be reported.

**Example 3 - Violation**: An employee learns of confidential acquisition plans and shares them with a friend who works at a competitor. This violates confidentiality and integrity. It should be reported immediately.

## Enforcement

- Violations may result in corrective action up to and including termination of employment.
- Contractors may have their agreements terminated.
- Legal action may be pursued where appropriate (e.g., fraud, theft, defamation).
- The company reserves the right to take action based on conduct occurring outside work when it affects the workplace or the company's reputation.

## FAQ

A: When in doubt, ask. Contact HR or your manager. It is better to raise a concern than to ignore it.

A: No. Retaliation against good-faith reporters is prohibited. Anyone who retaliates will be disciplined.
