# Company Equipment and Asset Management Policy

## Scope

This policy covers the issuance, use, care, and return of company-owned equipment and assets, including laptops, monitors, peripherals, and other devices assigned to employees. It applies to all employees who receive company equipment. The policy supports the **Information Security Policy** (device security) and **Remote Work Policy** (equipment for remote work). IT and Facilities share responsibility; HR supports offboarding. Equipment is provided to enable work; it is company property and must be used and protected accordingly.

## Definitions

- **Company equipment**: Hardware, peripherals, and other assets owned or leased by the company and assigned to an employee.
- **Asset tag**: A unique identifier assigned to equipment for tracking.
- **Home office stipend**: A one-time or periodic allowance for remote employees to purchase approved equipment or setup items.

## Issuance

- **Eligibility**: Equipment is issued based on role requirements. Not all roles receive the same equipment.
- **Approval**: Manager approval is required. IT provisions per the approved configuration.
- **New hires**: Equipment is provisioned before or on the start date when possible. Remote employees receive equipment via shipping.
- **Documentation**: Asset tags and serial numbers are recorded. Employees sign an asset acknowledgment form upon receipt.
- **Remote/hybrid**: Home office stipend or equipment shipment per the **Remote Work Policy**. Stipend amount and eligible items are defined separately; consult HR.

## Acceptable Use

- **Primary use**: Equipment is for business use. Incidental personal use is permitted per the **Acceptable Use Policy**.
- **Modifications**: Do not modify, jailbreak, or alter the device in ways that compromise security or warranty.
- **Software**: Install only approved software through IT-approved channels. No sideloading or unapproved applications.
- **Security**: Follow the **Information Security Policy**. Enable encryption, screen lock, and MFA. Do not disable security features.

## Care and Security

- **Physical security**: Lock equipment when unattended. Do not leave devices in unattended vehicles or public spaces.
- **Loss or theft**: Report to IT and your manager **immediately**. A ticket will be created; remote wipe may be initiated for mobile devices.
- **Lending**: Do not lend equipment to unauthorized persons, including family members.
- **Environment**: Use equipment in environments that do not pose excessive risk (e.g., extreme temperatures, moisture). Protect from physical damage.
- **Data protection**: Follow the **Information Security Policy** for data handling. Do not store sensitive data on unencrypted removable media.

## Maintenance and Upgrades

- **Routine maintenance**: IT performs patches and updates remotely when possible. Do not delay or disable updates without IT approval.
- **Repairs**: Report malfunctions to the IT helpdesk. Do not attempt repairs yourself or use third-party repair services without IT approval.
- **Refresh cycle**: Laptops are typically refreshed every 3–4 years. IT will coordinate replacement. Legacy equipment must be returned when replaced.
- **Peripherals**: Request additional or replacement peripherals through the IT portal. Approval may be required for non-standard items.

## Return of Equipment

- **When**: Upon separation (see **Termination and Offboarding Policy**), role change, or when IT requests return (e.g., refresh, reassignment).
- **Condition**: Return equipment in good condition. Normal wear is acceptable; damage beyond normal wear may result in cost recovery.
- **Remote employees**: Use the prepaid shipping label provided by IT. Pack securely; retain tracking information. Notify IT when shipped.
- **Timeline**: Return by the last day of employment or within the timeframe specified by IT. Delays may affect final pay or result in cost recovery.
- **Data**: Ensure company data is not retained on personal backups or cloud accounts. IT may wipe devices upon return.

## Lost or Damaged Equipment

- **Negligent loss or damage**: May result in cost recovery up to the depreciated value. HR and IT will assess and communicate any charges.
- **Intentional misuse**: May result in disciplinary action and cost recovery.
- **Theft**: File a police report when applicable. Provide the report to IT. Cost recovery may be waived with a police report; consult HR.
- **Insurance**: The company may have insurance for certain scenarios. IT and HR will advise.

## Examples

**Example 1**: An employee's laptop is damaged when coffee is spilled on it. They report to IT. The device is assessed; if the damage is due to negligence, the employee may be responsible for repair or replacement cost up to depreciated value.

**Example 2**: An employee resigns. On their last day, they return their laptop, monitor, and badge to the office. They receive a receipt. IT confirms the device is returned and updates records.

**Example 3**: A remote employee's laptop is stolen from their car. They report immediately, file a police report, and provide the report to IT. IT initiates remote wipe. The company may waive cost recovery given the police report and immediate reporting.
