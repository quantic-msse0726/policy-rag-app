# Remote Work Policy

## Scope

This policy outlines the expectations, eligibility, and guidelines for remote and hybrid work arrangements. Remote work supports flexibility while maintaining productivity, team cohesion, and security. This policy applies to all employees whose roles are designated as remote-eligible or hybrid. Security requirements align with the **Information Security Policy** and **Equipment and Asset Management Policy**; employees must comply with those policies when working remotely.

## Definitions

- **Remote work**: Work performed from a location other than a company office (e.g., home, co-working space).
- **Hybrid work**: A schedule combining in-office and remote days.
- **Core hours**: Designated hours when employees must be available for meetings and collaboration.
- **Approved location**: A location that meets security and ergonomic requirements and has been acknowledged by the company.

## Eligibility

- Roles designated as **remote-eligible** may work from home or another approved location.
- Eligibility is determined by job function, team needs, manager approval, and business requirements.
- New hires may be assessed for remote eligibility during onboarding; eligibility is not guaranteed.
- Some roles (e.g., facilities, certain lab positions) may require on-site presence and are not eligible.
- Eligibility may be revised based on performance, business need, or policy changes. A 30-day notice will be provided when possible.

## Core Requirements

- **Core hours**: 10:00 AM–2:00 PM in your local time zone. Be available for meetings, Slack, email, or phone during this window.
- **Availability**: Must be reachable during core hours unless on approved PTO or leave.
- **Equipment**: Company-issued laptop and peripherals are required. A home office stipend may be available for approved setups; see HR for details.
- **Security**: Use VPN for all access to internal systems. Do not perform work on personal devices unless explicitly approved and configured per IT policy. See **Information Security Policy** for details.
- **Environment**: Work from a space that allows focused work and maintains confidentiality of conversations and data.

## Hybrid Schedule

- **Hybrid employees** work 2–3 days per week in the office, as determined by team and manager.
- In-office days are coordinated with your team to maximize face-to-face collaboration.
- Attendance may be tracked via badge access for hybrid compliance and space planning.
- Teams may establish anchor days when most team members are in office.

## Policy

### Performance Expectations

- Deliverables and deadlines are the same regardless of work location.
- Participate in required meetings; video-on when appropriate and when bandwidth permits.
- Maintain responsive communication; same turnaround expectations as in-office colleagues.
- Managers will evaluate performance based on outcomes, not presence.

### Equipment and Security

- All work must be performed on company-owned devices. See **Equipment and Asset Management Policy**.
- Home networks should use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption.
- Sensitive documents must not be printed or stored at home without approval. Use secure digital channels.
- Return all equipment upon termination or change of arrangement; see the **Termination and Offboarding Policy**.

### Workspace and Ergonomic Considerations

- Ensure a safe, ergonomic workspace. Report injuries or concerns to HR.
- The company is not responsible for home workspace modifications unless provided through an approved accommodation.

## Procedures

### Requesting Remote or Hybrid Arrangement

1. Discuss with your manager during hiring or as part of a role change.
2. Complete any required acknowledgment or agreement.
3. Confirm equipment, VPN, and access setup with IT.
4. Agree on core hours and team norms with your manager.

### Changing or Revoking Arrangement

- Arrangements may be revised based on performance, business need, or policy changes.
- Employees may request a change (e.g., from remote to hybrid) by discussing with their manager.
- The company will provide 30 days notice when revoking or materially changing an arrangement when feasible.

## Examples

**Example 1**: A hybrid employee works Tuesday–Thursday in the office and Monday and Friday from home. They ensure they are available 10am–2pm local time on all days.

**Example 2**: A remote employee travels to a different time zone temporarily. They adjust their core hours overlap with their team and inform their manager.

**Example 3**: An employee's home internet goes down. They notify their manager and may use a backup location (e.g., café with secure connection) if approved, or take PTO if unable to work.

## Enforcement

- Failure to meet availability, security, or performance expectations may result in revision or revocation of the arrangement and/or disciplinary action.
- Violations of security requirements are addressed under the **Information Security Policy**.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I work from another country?**  
A: Generally no, unless explicitly approved. Tax, legal, and compliance implications apply. Discuss with HR before making such arrangements.

**Q: Is the home office stipend taxable?**  
A: Stipend may be taxable income. Consult HR and your tax advisor.

**Q: What if I need to care for a dependent during work hours?**  
A: Discuss with your manager. Flexibility may be available; sustained caregiving during core hours may require PTO or other arrangements.
