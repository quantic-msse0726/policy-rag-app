# Business Expenses Policy

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees who incur business-related expenses on behalf of the company. Reimbursement is subject to approval, documentation, and compliance requirements. This policy covers travel, meals, entertainment, and other business expenses. Consultants and contractors should refer to their agreement for expense terms. The Finance department owns this policy; managers are responsible for approving expenses within their authority.

## Definitions

- **Business expense**: A cost incurred while conducting company business that is reasonable, necessary, and properly documented.
- **Per diem**: A daily allowance for meals and incidental expenses when traveling, in lieu of itemized receipts.
- **Pre-approval**: Authorization obtained before incurring an expense, required for amounts above certain thresholds.
- **Itemized receipt**: A receipt showing individual items purchased, not just a total.
