# Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Policy

## Scope

This policy protects proprietary, confidential, and sensitive information belonging to the company, its customers, and partners. All employees must maintain confidentiality as a condition of employment. This policy applies to all employees and may apply to contractors and third parties who have access to confidential information. It works in conjunction with the **Information Security Policy** (technical controls) and **Code of Conduct** (integrity standards). Legal owns this policy; HR and Security support enforcement.

## Definitions

- **Confidential information**: Information that is not publicly available and is subject to protection, including trade secrets, business plans, financial data, customer data, and other proprietary information.
- **NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)**: A contract in which one or more parties agree not to disclose certain information.
- **Need-to-know**: Access limited to individuals who require the information to perform their job duties.
- **Trade secret**: Information that derives economic value from not being generally known and is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy.

## Confidential Information

Confidential information includes, but is not limited to:

- **Business information**: Financial data, strategy, roadmaps, pricing, margins, M&A activity, and business plans.
- **Technical information**: Source code, algorithms, designs, formulas, processes, and trade secrets.
- **Customer information**: Customer contacts, contracts, requirements, and any non-public customer data.
- **Personnel information**: Salaries, performance data, personal information of employees, and organizational structure.
- **Partner/vendor information**: Terms, agreements, pricing, and confidential communications with partners and vendors.
- **Marketing and product**: Unreleased product plans, marketing strategies, and competitive intelligence.

Information may be marked as "Confidential," "Internal Only," or similar. Absence of a marking does not mean information is not confidential; apply reasonable judgment.

## Obligations

- **Access**: Access confidential information only on a need-to-know basis. Do not access information unrelated to your role.
- **Disclosure**: Do not disclose confidential information outside the organization without prior written approval from Legal or an authorized designee.
- **Use**: Do not use confidential information for personal benefit or to benefit a third party.
- **Handling**: Mark and handle documents according to the **Information Security Policy** classification. Use secure channels for storage and transmission.
- **Destruction**: When no longer needed, destroy or return confidential information per the retention policy. Do not retain in personal files or devices.

## Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)

- **With the company**: Employees may be required to sign an NDA with the company as a condition of employment or for access to specific projects.
- **With third parties**: When engaging with third parties (e.g., vendors, partners, customers), ensure appropriate NDAs are in place before sharing information. Do not sign external NDAs on behalf of the company without Legal review.
- **Incoming NDAs**: If a third party asks you to sign an NDA, forward to Legal for review. Legal will approve, revise, or decline.

## Duration

- **Survival**: Confidentiality obligations survive termination of employment. You remain bound after you leave the company.
- **Return/destruction**: Upon separation, return or destroy all confidential materials. Do not retain copies in any form. Confirm compliance if requested.
- **Ongoing**: Continue to refrain from disclosing or using confidential information after employment. Violations may result in legal action.

## Exceptions

- **Public information**: Information that becomes publicly available through no fault of yours (e.g., published by the company, legitimate public source).
- **Independent development**: Information you develop independently without use of or reference to confidential materials.
- **Legal requirement**: Disclosure required by law or court order. Where possible, notify Legal in advance so the company may seek a protective order or limit disclosure.
- **Written authorization**: Disclosure with prior written authorization from the company.

When in doubt about whether an exception applies, contact Legal.

## Procedures

### Sharing Information Externally

1. Determine whether the information is confidential.
2. Verify that an NDA is in place with the recipient. If not, contact Legal.
3. Limit disclosure to what is necessary for the purpose.
4. Mark documents as appropriate. Use secure channels.

### Reporting a Breach

1. If you suspect unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential information, report immediately to Legal and Security.
2. Preserve any relevant evidence. Do not delete emails or documents.
3. Cooperate with any investigation.

### Upon Separation

1. Return all company property, including devices and documents.
2. Delete or return any confidential information in your possession.
3. Do not retain copies. Confirm in writing if requested by the company.

## Enforcement

- Breaches may result in disciplinary action up to termination.
- The company may pursue legal remedies, including injunctive relief and damages.
- In some cases, breach may constitute a crime (e.g., trade secret theft). Law enforcement may be involved.

## Examples

**Example 1 - Permitted**: An employee shares pricing information with a customer under an existing NDA and with approval from their manager. The sharing is limited to what the customer needs.

**Example 2 - Violation**: An employee discusses unreleased product plans with a friend who works at a competitor. This violates confidentiality and may constitute trade secret theft.

**Example 3 - Violation**: A former employee takes a customer list to their new employer. This violates post-employment obligations and may result in legal action.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I discuss my work in general terms on LinkedIn or in interviews?**  
A: You may describe your role and high-level responsibilities. Do not disclose confidential details, strategies, or customer information. When in doubt, don't.

**Q: What if I receive a subpoena or court order?**  
A: Contact Legal immediately. Do not respond until Legal advises. The company may need to seek a protective order.

**Q: Does this apply to information I develop?**  
A: Yes. Information you develop in the course of employment or using company resources generally belongs to the company. Your employment agreement may specify. Consult Legal if uncertain.
