# Performance Review Policy

## Scope

This policy defines the process and expectations for performance reviews. Regular feedback and formal reviews support employee growth, alignment with organizational goals, and fair compensation decisions. This policy applies to all employees; contractors may have different arrangements per their agreement. The policy supports our commitment to development and accountability as articulated in the **Code of Conduct** and **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policy**. HR and managers share responsibility for implementation.

## Definitions

- **Performance review**: A formal assessment of an employee's performance over a defined period, typically annually.
- **Goals**: Objectives that define expected outcomes and success criteria.
- **Calibration**: A process where managers compare ratings across a group to ensure consistency.
- **PIP (Performance Improvement Plan)**: A documented plan with clear objectives and timeline to address performance gaps.

## Review Cycle

- **Annual review**: Conducted in Q1 for the prior calendar year. Impacts merit increases, bonuses, and development planning.
- **Mid-year check-in**: Informal progress discussion; no rating change. Focus on feedback and goal adjustment.
- **Probationary review**: At 30, 60, and 90 days for new hires. Determines successful completion of probation.
- **Project-based**: Optional for employees on project or role transitions; manager discretion.

## Review Components

1. **Self-assessment**: Employee completes a self-review reflecting on goals, achievements, challenges, and development interests.
2. **Manager assessment**: Manager evaluates performance against goals and competencies. Gathers input from stakeholders as appropriate.
3. **Calibration**: Where applicable, managers calibrate ratings within their team or department to ensure fairness and consistency.
4. **Discussion**: Feedback is shared in a dedicated 1:1. Employee may add comments or rebuttals to the written review.
5. **Documentation**: Final review is documented in the HR system. Employee acknowledges receipt.

## Rating Scale

| Rating | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Exceeds | Consistently exceeds expectations; exceptional contribution; role model for others |
| Meets | Meets expectations; solid, reliable performance; delivers on commitments |
| Partially Meets | Some gaps; improvement plan may be required; not all goals achieved |
| Does Not Meet | Significant gaps; PIP required; performance below acceptable level |

- Most employees are expected to fall in the Meets or Exceeds range.
- Partially Meets and Does Not Meet trigger discussion of support, improvement plans, or other outcomes.

## Goals

- **SMART**: Goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
- **Alignment**: Goals align with team and company objectives. Employees typically have 3–5 goals.
- **Updates**: Goals may be updated during the year with manager approval. Document changes.
- **Stretch**: Some goals may be aspirational; discuss with your manager what "stretch" means for your role.

## Performance Improvement

- When performance does not meet expectations, a **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** may be initiated.
- PIPs include: clear objectives, success criteria, timeline (typically 30–90 days), support resources, and check-in schedule.
- Success: Employee meets PIP objectives; returns to normal review cycle.
- Failure: Employee does not meet objectives; may result in separation. The company will follow applicable notice and procedures.
- PIP is confidential; only those with need-to-know are informed.

## Procedures

### Annual Review Process

1. HR opens the review cycle; managers receive instructions.
2. Employees complete self-assessment by the deadline.
3. Managers complete assessments and participate in calibration if applicable.
4. Managers conduct review discussions with employees.
5. Employees acknowledge receipt. Final reviews are stored in HR system.
6. Compensation decisions (merit, bonus) are communicated per company timeline.

### Manager Responsibilities

- Provide ongoing feedback throughout the year, not just at review time.
- Conduct reviews fairly and consistently. Avoid recency bias.
- Document performance concerns when they occur.
- Support development and address performance gaps promptly.

## Examples

**Example 1**: An employee receives "Meets" with positive feedback on collaboration and delivery. One goal was partially met due to external factors; the manager notes this and adjusts next year's goals accordingly.

**Example 2**: An employee receives "Partially Meets" due to missed deadlines. The manager creates a PIP with weekly check-ins, clearer prioritization, and access to project management training. The employee completes the PIP successfully.

**Example 3**: An employee receives "Does Not Meet" and does not improve during the PIP. After the PIP period, the manager and HR determine that separation is appropriate. The Termination and Offboarding Policy is followed.

## Enforcement

- Managers who do not conduct reviews in a timely or fair manner may be subject to review.
- Employees who falsify self-assessments or otherwise game the process may face disciplinary action.
- Reviews are subject to audit for consistency and compliance.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I dispute my rating?**  
A: You may add comments or a rebuttal to the review. For serious concerns, discuss with your manager or HR. HR can facilitate review of the process.

**Q: How does calibration work?**  
A: Managers may meet to compare ratings across employees, ensure consistent application of criteria, and adjust if warranted. Individual discussions remain confidential.

**Q: What if I'm on a PIP and have a medical or personal issue?**  
A: Discuss with your manager and HR. Accommodations or extensions may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
