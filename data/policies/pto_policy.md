# Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy

## Scope

This policy establishes the guidelines for paid time off for all full-time and eligible part-time employees. PTO is designed to support work-life balance and employee well-being while maintaining business continuity. This policy applies to all employees in the United States; international employees should refer to local country policies. The policy supersedes any prior verbal or written arrangements regarding vacation or sick leave.

## Definitions

- **PTO (Paid Time Off)**: A bank of days that may be used for vacation, personal time, or short-term illness.
- **Accrual**: The gradual earning of PTO based on hours worked or months of service.
- **Carryover**: Unused PTO from one calendar year that may be applied to the following year.
- **Immediate family**: Spouse, domestic partner, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, and step-family in these categories.
- **Primary caregiver**: The employee who will primarily care for the new child; typically the birth parent or primary adoptive parent.

## Eligibility

- **Full-time employees** accrue PTO from their first day of employment.
- **Part-time employees** (scheduled 20 or more hours per week) receive prorated PTO based on hours worked.
- **Part-time employees** (under 20 hours/week) are not eligible for PTO.
- **Contractors, temporary workers, and interns** are not eligible for PTO benefits.
- Employees on unpaid leave do not accrue PTO during the leave period.
- Rehired employees may receive credit for prior service at the company's discretion; contact HR for determination.

## Accrual Rates

| Years of Service | Annual Accrual | Monthly Equivalent |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 0–2 years        | 15 days       | 1.25 days           |
| 3–5 years       | 20 days       | 1.67 days           |
| 6+ years         | 25 days       | 2.08 days           |

- Accrual begins on the first day of employment and is calculated on each pay period.
- Accrual rates apply to the calendar year; employees who cross a tenure threshold mid-year receive the new rate from the start of the next calendar year.
- Unused PTO may be carried over up to **5 days** into the next calendar year; any excess is forfeited on January 31.
- New hires who start mid-year receive prorated accrual for the remainder of the year.
- PTO balances are visible in the HR portal; employees are responsible for tracking their usage.

## Policy

### Requesting Time Off

1. Submit requests through the HR portal at least **14 calendar days** in advance for planned absences whenever possible.
2. For emergency or same-day requests, notify your manager immediately and log the request in the system within 48 hours.
3. Manager approval is required; approval or denial will be communicated within 3 business days.
4. When multiple employees request the same dates, conflicts are resolved by seniority of request submission date.
5. Block-out periods (e.g., quarter-end close, mandatory all-hands) may restrict PTO; check the team calendar and consult your manager.
6. PTO may not be used to extend a notice period when resigning.

### Scheduling Considerations

- Employees are encouraged to schedule PTO in a way that minimizes impact on team operations.
- Consecutive PTO of more than 10 business days may require additional manager approval.
- Unused PTO has no cash value and is not paid out upon termination, except where required by state law.

## Procedures

### How to Submit a PTO Request

1. Log into the HR portal and navigate to Time Off.
2. Select the date range and indicate whether the time is for vacation, personal, or sick leave.
3. Add any comments (e.g., coverage arrangements) if desired.
4. Submit for manager approval.
5. Await approval notification; if denied, discuss alternatives with your manager.

### Manager Responsibilities

## Special Provisions

### Bereavement Leave

### Jury Duty

- Paid leave for the full duration of jury duty or court-mandated service.
- Employees must provide documentation from the court.
- Pay will be the difference between jury duty compensation and regular salary if the employee chooses to retain jury pay.

### Parental Leave

- **Primary caregivers**: 12 weeks of paid parental leave following birth or adoption.
- **Secondary caregivers**: 2 weeks of paid parental leave.
- Leave must be taken within 12 months of the birth or adoption.
- Parental leave runs concurrently with FMLA where applicable; see HR for state-specific requirements.

### Voting

- Up to 2 hours of paid time for voting when polls are not open outside working hours.

## Examples

**Example 1**: An employee with 4 years of service accrues 20 days per year. They use 15 days for a family vacation and carry over 5 days to the next year. Any additional unused days are forfeited.

**Example 2**: An employee needs same-day PTO for a sick child. They notify their manager by 8 a.m. and enter the request in the portal by the end of the day. The manager approves retroactively.

**Example 3**: Two employees request the same week off. The one who submitted first receives approval; the other is asked to choose alternate dates or may be approved if coverage can be arranged.

## Enforcement

- Abuse of PTO (e.g., falsifying sick leave, failing to follow request procedures) may result in disciplinary action up to termination.
- Managers who fail to process requests in a timely manner may be subject to review.
- HR reserves the right to audit PTO usage and request documentation for extended sick leave.
