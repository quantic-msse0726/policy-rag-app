# Harassment Prevention and Complaint Procedure

## Scope

This policy defines prohibited conduct and the process for reporting and addressing complaints of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. We are committed to a workplace free from such conduct. This policy applies to all employees and may apply to contractors and third parties when they interact with our workforce. It complements the **Code of Conduct** and **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policy**. HR owns this policy and coordinates investigations; Legal is consulted as needed.

## Definitions

- **Harassment**: Unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic (e.g., race, sex, religion, age, disability, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity) that creates a hostile work environment or results in a tangible employment action.
- **Sexual harassment**: Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Includes quid pro quo (something for something) and hostile environment harassment.
- **Discrimination**: Unfavorable treatment of an individual based on a protected characteristic in hiring, promotion, compensation, or other terms or conditions of employment.
- **Retaliation**: Adverse action against an individual for reporting prohibited conduct, participating in an investigation, or opposing such conduct.
- **Protected characteristics**: Race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, and other characteristics protected by applicable law.
- **Hostile work environment**: Conduct that is severe or pervasive enough to create an intimidating, offensive, or abusive work environment.
- **Tangible employment action**: A significant change in employment status (e.g., hire, fire, promotion, demotion, reassignment, compensation).

## Policy Statement

We prohibit harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. All employees are expected to treat each other with respect and professionalism. Anyone who engages in prohibited conduct will be subject to corrective action up to and including termination. We will take prompt and appropriate action to address complaints and prevent recurrence.

## Prohibited Conduct

### Harassment

- Unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic that creates a hostile environment or results in a tangible employment action.
- Offensive jokes, slurs, epithets, or derogatory comments.
- Unwanted physical contact or advances.
- Display of offensive images or materials.
- Stereotyping or marginalizing individuals based on identity.
- Bullying, intimidation, or threatening behavior.

### Sexual Harassment

- Unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors.
- Verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature (e.g., sexual comments, gestures, touching).
- Quid pro quo: conditioning employment benefits on submission to unwelcome sexual conduct.
- Hostile environment: sexual conduct that is severe or pervasive enough to create an intimidating or offensive environment.

### Discrimination

- Unfavorable treatment in hiring, promotion, compensation, termination, or other terms of employment based on a protected characteristic.
- Failure to provide reasonable accommodations where required by law.
- Policies or practices that have a disproportionate adverse impact on a protected group and are not job-related and consistent with business necessity.

### Retaliation

- Adverse action against an individual for reporting, participating in an investigation, or opposing prohibited conduct.
- Examples: termination, demotion, reduction in hours, exclusion from meetings, negative performance evaluation, hostile treatment.
- Retaliation is prohibited even if the underlying report is not substantiated, so long as the report was made in good faith.

## Reporting

- **Who to contact**: Your manager, HR, any member of leadership, or the Ethics Hotline.
- **Confidentiality**: Reports are handled as confidentially as possible. Need-to-know disclosure may be necessary for investigation and remedy. We do not promise absolute confidentiality.
- **Timing**: Report promptly. Delaying may affect our ability to investigate and remedy.
- **Anonymous reporting**: Available where permitted by law. Anonymous reports may limit our ability to investigate fully.
- **No requirement to confront**: You are not required to confront the alleged harasser. Report to any of the contacts above.

## Investigation

- **Prompt**: Complaints are investigated promptly. We aim to complete investigations within a reasonable timeframe.
- **Fair**: Both the complainant and the respondent have the opportunity to provide information. We gather relevant evidence.
- **Thorough**: We interview witnesses, review documents, and assess credibility as appropriate.
- **External investigators**: May be used when appropriate (e.g., senior leaders involved, complex matters).
- **Documentation**: Findings are documented. Corrective action is taken when violations are substantiated.

## Corrective Action

- **Remedies**: May include training, counseling, warning, change of assignment, suspension, or termination.
- **Proportionality**: Action is proportionate to the severity of the conduct.
- **Retaliation**: Retaliation against complainants or witnesses is itself a violation and will be addressed.
- **Non-retaliation**: We will not take adverse action against individuals for reporting in good faith, even if the report is not substantiated.

## Support

- **EAP**: The Employee Assistance Program offers confidential counseling and support.
- **Accommodations**: We may accommodate reporting parties (e.g., temporary schedule change, reporting structure) to address concerns during the investigation.
- **External resources**: You may also contact the EEOC or state fair employment agency. We do not require internal exhaustion before external contact, but we encourage internal reporting so we can address concerns.

## Procedures

### Making a Report

1. Contact your manager, HR, or the Ethics Hotline.
2. Provide as much detail as possible: what occurred, when, where, who was involved, any witnesses.
3. Preserve any relevant evidence (e.g., emails, messages).
4. You may bring a support person to meetings if desired (e.g., colleague, union representative where applicable).

### Investigation Process

1. HR (or designee) receives the report and assesses. May conduct preliminary inquiry.
2. Respondent is notified of the allegations and given opportunity to respond. Confidentiality is emphasized.
3. Witnesses are interviewed. Documents are reviewed.
4. Findings are determined. Complainant and respondent may be notified of the outcome to the extent appropriate.
5. Corrective action is taken if violations are substantiated.
6. Follow-up may be conducted to ensure the conduct has stopped and retaliation has not occurred.

### Manager Responsibilities

- Take all reports seriously. Do not ignore or minimize.
- Report to HR. Do not attempt to investigate independently in a way that could compromise the process.
- Support the complainant and ensure they are not subjected to retaliation.
- Maintain confidentiality to the extent possible.

## Examples

**Example 1 - Harassment**: An employee repeatedly makes jokes about a colleague's religion. The colleague finds it offensive and reports. After investigation, the conduct is substantiated. The offending employee receives a written warning and required training. Further incidents could result in termination.

**Example 2 - Sexual harassment**: A manager suggests that an employee's promotion depends on going on a date. The employee reports. Investigation confirms quid pro quo harassment. The manager is terminated.

**Example 3 - Retaliation**: An employee reports harassment. Shortly after, their manager excludes them from meetings and gives them a negative review. The employee reports the retaliation. Investigation substantiates retaliation. The manager is disciplined.

## Enforcement

- Violations will result in corrective action. Serious or repeated violations will result in termination.
- Contractors and third parties may have their access revoked and agreements terminated.
- We will not tolerate retaliation. Anyone who retaliates will be disciplined.

## FAQ

**Q: What if I'm not sure it's harassment?**  
A: Report it. HR can help assess. It is better to report and have us determine it's not a violation than to suffer in silence.

**Q: Will the harasser be told I reported them?**  
A: The respondent is generally informed of the allegations so they can respond. We strive to protect confidentiality while conducting a fair investigation.

**Q: Can I report something I witnessed?**  
A: Yes. Bystander reports are welcome. You do not need to be the direct target.

**Q: What if I report and nothing happens?**  
A: We investigate all reports. If you believe the process was inadequate, escalate to HR leadership or the Ethics Hotline. You may also contact the EEOC or state agency.
