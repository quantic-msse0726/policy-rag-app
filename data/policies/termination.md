# Termination and Offboarding Policy

## Scope

This policy covers voluntary resignations, involuntary terminations, and the offboarding process for all employees. It ensures consistent, respectful treatment and protection of company and employee interests. This policy applies to all employees; contractors may have different terms per their agreement. The policy works in conjunction with the **Equipment and Asset Management Policy** (equipment return) and **Information Security Policy** (access revocation). HR owns this policy; managers and IT support execution.

## Definitions

- **Voluntary resignation**: Employee-initiated separation (e.g., resignation, retirement).
- **Involuntary termination**: Company-initiated separation (e.g., for cause, redundancy, restructuring).
- **Notice period**: The period between notice and the last day of employment.
- **Offboarding**: The process of transitioning an employee out of the organization, including access revocation, equipment return, and knowledge transfer.

## Voluntary Resignation

- **Notice**: Employees should provide written notice as specified in their offer letter (typically 2 weeks for non-exempt, 2–4 weeks for exempt). Notice may be given via email to the manager and HR.
- **During notice**: Employees are expected to complete handover tasks, document knowledge, and assist in transition. Performance expectations remain in effect.
- **PTO**: Unused PTO is handled per the PTO Policy and applicable state law. PTO may not be used to extend the notice period.
- **Exit interview**: HR offers an exit interview to gather feedback. Participation is voluntary but encouraged.
- **Final pay**: Final paycheck and any owed amounts are processed per state law (e.g., within a defined period after separation). Benefits continuation (e.g., COBRA) information is provided.

## Involuntary Termination

- **For cause**: Terminations for performance, conduct, or policy violations. Require documentation, PIP (if applicable), and HR review. Employee is informed privately and given information on final pay, benefits, and next steps.
- **Business reasons**: Terminations due to redundancy, restructuring, or elimination of role. Notice or pay in lieu is provided per applicable law (e.g., WARN) and company policy. Severance may be offered; terms are in a separation agreement.
- **Process**: HR and the manager coordinate. The employee is informed in a private meeting. A written confirmation may be provided. Access is revoked promptly.

## Examples

**Example 1**: An employee resigns with 2 weeks notice. They complete handover, return their laptop and badge on the last day, and participate in an exit interview. Final pay is processed within the state-required timeframe.

**Example 2**: An employee is terminated for cause following a PIP. They are informed in a meeting with HR and their manager. Access is revoked the same day. Equipment return is arranged. Final pay is processed per law.

**Example 3**: A role is eliminated in a restructuring. The employee receives notice (or pay in lieu), severance per the separation agreement, and COBRA information. They return equipment and complete offboarding.
