# Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

## Scope

This policy defines acceptable use of company IT resources, including computers, networks, email, internet access, software, and cloud services. All employees, contractors, and authorized users must comply to protect the organization, its stakeholders, and its customers. This policy works in conjunction with the **Information Security Policy** and **Code of Conduct**; violations may be addressed under any applicable policy. The IT department owns this policy and enforces it with support from HR and Legal.

## Definitions

- **IT resources**: Any company-owned or company-provisioned hardware, software, network, or cloud service used to conduct company business.
- **Incidental personal use**: Brief, minimal use that does not interfere with work, consume significant resources, or create security or legal risk.
- **Prohibited use**: Any use that violates this policy, law, or other company policies.

## Permitted Use

- **Business purposes**: All IT resources are provided primarily for work-related activities. Use must support job duties, collaboration, and company goals.
- **Incidental personal use**: Brief, minimal personal use (e.g., quick web search, checking personal email during break) is permitted if it does not interfere with work, consume excessive bandwidth, or create security risk. Such use is a privilege, not a right.
- **Learning and development**: Access to professional resources, documentation, training materials, and technical forums is encouraged.
- **Communication**: Use of company email and messaging for work communication; personal use must remain incidental.

## Prohibited Use

- **Illegal activity**: Any use that violates applicable law, including piracy, fraud, harassment, defamation, or unauthorized access to systems or data.
- **Inappropriate content**: Accessing, storing, or distributing pornography, hate speech, violent content, or material that could create a hostile work environment.
- **Malware and hacking**: Introducing malware, circumventing security controls, attempting unauthorized access, or testing security without approval.
- **Resource abuse**: Mining cryptocurrency, running personal servers, hosting personal websites, or consuming excessive non-business bandwidth.
- **Confidentiality violations**: Sharing company or customer data through unapproved channels (see **Confidentiality and NDA Policy**).
- **Impersonation**: Sending communications that falsely represent the sender or the company.
- **Spam or bulk unsolicited messaging**: Sending mass unsolicited emails or messages except for approved business communications.

## Email and Messaging

- Use company email for business communication. Avoid forwarding company email to personal accounts; when necessary, use approved secure methods.
- No mass unsolicited messaging (spam) or impersonation. Marketing or bulk communications must follow applicable laws (e.g., CAN-SPAM).
- Emails and messaging may be monitored for security, compliance, and policy enforcement. There is no expectation of privacy for business communications.
- Retain and delete email in accordance with the company's retention policy; do not use personal archives to circumvent retention.

## Software and Licensing

- Install only approved, licensed software. Obtain software through the IT portal or approved procurement process.
- Do not use cracked, pirated, or unlicensed software. Report software needs to IT for legitimate procurement.
- Open-source software must comply with license terms and receive IT approval before use in production or on company systems.
- Unapproved software may be removed by IT; persistent violations may result in disciplinary action.

## Monitoring and Enforcement

- IT may monitor system usage for security, compliance, capacity planning, and policy enforcement.
- Logs, traffic data, and system activity may be retained and reviewed. Use of resources implies consent to monitoring within legal limits.
- Violations may result in warning, restricted access, disciplinary action up to termination, and legal action where appropriate.
- Serious violations (e.g., illegal activity, data theft) may be reported to law enforcement.

## Procedures

### Reporting Violations

- Report suspected violations to your manager, IT (it-policy@company.com), or the Ethics Hotline.
- Reports may be anonymous where permitted by law.
- Retaliation against good-faith reporters is prohibited.

### Handling a Violation

- IT may investigate, gather evidence, and take technical measures (e.g., disabling accounts).
- HR may be involved for disciplinary action.
- Legal may be consulted for significant or recurring violations.

## Examples

**Example 1 - Permitted**: An employee briefly checks personal email during lunch on the company network. This is incidental personal use and acceptable.

**Example 2 - Prohibited**: An employee runs a cryptocurrency miner on a company machine. This consumes resources and violates the resource abuse prohibition.

**Example 3 - Prohibited**: An employee accesses a colleague's email without authorization. This violates both this policy and the Information Security Policy.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I stream music or videos while working?**  
A: Minimal, low-bandwidth streaming may be acceptable if it does not impact work or network performance. Manager discretion applies.

**Q: What if I need software that's not in the approved list?**  
A: Submit a request to IT with business justification. IT will evaluate and procure if appropriate.

**Q: Are my personal files on the company laptop private?**
