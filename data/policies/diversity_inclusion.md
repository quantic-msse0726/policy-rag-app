# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policy

## Scope

This policy articulates our commitment to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace where all employees feel valued and can contribute their best work. It guides our practices in hiring, promotion, development, culture, and accountability. This policy applies to all employees and complements our **Code of Conduct** and **Harassment Prevention and Complaint Procedure**. The company leadership owns this policy; managers and HR share responsibility for implementation.

## Definitions

- **Diversity**: The presence of differences in background, identity, experience, and perspective—including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion, and veteran status.
- **Equity**: Fair treatment, access, and opportunity for all, with attention to barriers that have historically excluded certain groups.
- **Inclusion**: An environment where everyone belongs, can participate fully, and feels respected and valued.
- **Microaggressions**: Subtle, often unintentional comments or behaviors that demean or marginalize individuals based on their identity.

## Commitment

We are committed to:

- Building and sustaining a workforce that reflects the diversity of our customers and communities.
- Ensuring that policies, practices, and decisions promote equity and do not create unnecessary barriers.
- Creating an inclusive culture where all employees can thrive, contribute, and advance.
- Holding ourselves accountable through measurement, transparency, and continuous improvement.

## Recruitment and Hiring

- **Job postings**: Use inclusive language and avoid unnecessary requirements that could exclude qualified candidates.
- **Sourcing**: Proactively source from diverse candidate pools, including job boards, organizations, and networks that serve underrepresented groups.
- **Hiring panels**: Include diverse perspectives on hiring panels when feasible.
- **Selection**: Base selection on qualifications, skills, and fit. Use structured interviews and consistent criteria to reduce bias.
- **Bias reduction**: Hiring managers complete bias awareness training. Review job descriptions for gendered or exclusionary language.
- **Accommodations**: Offer reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities throughout the hiring process. Contact HR for support.

## Development and Promotion

- **Access**: Ensure that development opportunities (training, mentorship, stretch assignments) are accessible to all employees.
- **Transparency**: Promotion criteria are documented and communicated. Employees know what is required to advance.
- **Consistency**: Apply criteria consistently across candidates. Use calibration and multiple inputs where appropriate.
- **Mentorship and sponsorship**: Support programs that connect underrepresented employees with mentors and sponsors who can advocate for their advancement.

## Workplace Culture

- **Prohibited conduct**: Discriminatory behavior, harassment, and microaggressions are not tolerated. See **Harassment Prevention and Complaint Procedure**.
- **Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)**: Support ERGs that provide community, advocacy, and input. ERGs are open to allies.
- **Inclusive meetings**: Encourage inclusive meeting norms (e.g., rotating facilitators, written summaries, equal speaking time).
- **Feedback**: Provide channels for employees to raise concerns anonymously when desired. Act on feedback.

## Policy

### Accountability

- **Goals**: DEI goals are incorporated into organizational and leadership objectives where appropriate.
- **Metrics**: Track representation, retention, and inclusion metrics. Report progress to leadership and, at a high level, to employees.
- **Review**: This policy is reviewed annually. Practices are updated based on feedback, data, and best practices.

### Responsibilities

- **Leadership**: Set tone, allocate resources, and hold managers accountable.
- **Managers**: Model inclusive behavior, ensure fair practices, and address issues promptly.
- **HR**: Design and support programs, provide guidance, and facilitate reporting and resolution.
- **All employees**: Contribute to an inclusive environment and speak up when they see exclusion or bias.

## Procedures

### Reporting Concerns

- Report discrimination, harassment, or bias to your manager, HR, or the Ethics Hotline.
- Reports are investigated promptly. Retaliation is prohibited.
- Anonymous reporting is available where permitted by law.

### Requesting Accommodations

- Contact HR to request accommodations for disability, religion, or other protected characteristics.
- HR will engage in an interactive process to identify reasonable accommodations.

## Examples

**Example 1**: A hiring manager ensures that the interview panel includes at least one person from a different background and uses the same questions for all candidates.

**Example 2**: An employee notices that a colleague is consistently interrupted in meetings. They speak up to ensure the colleague's ideas are heard and suggest a round-robin format.

**Example 3**: An employee requests a religious accommodation to observe a holiday. HR works with the employee and manager to arrange schedule flexibility.

## Enforcement

- Violations (e.g., discrimination, harassment, retaliation) are addressed under applicable policies and may result in disciplinary action up to termination.
- Managers who fail to promote an inclusive environment or address issues may be subject to review.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I join an ERG?**  
A: Contact the ERG lead or HR. Most ERGs welcome all employees; some have specific focus areas.

**Q: What if I witnessed bias but wasn't directly affected?**  
A: You can still report. Bystander reports help the company address patterns and improve the environment.

**Q: How is progress on DEI measured?**  
A: We track representation, retention, promotion rates, and inclusion survey results. High-level updates are shared periodically.
