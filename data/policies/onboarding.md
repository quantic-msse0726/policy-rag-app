# Employee Onboarding Policy

## Scope

This policy outlines the standard onboarding experience for new employees. Effective onboarding ensures new hires are productive quickly, understand company culture and expectations, and integrate well into their teams. This policy applies to all new hires; contractors and temporary workers may have abbreviated onboarding per their agreement. The policy aligns with our commitment to inclusion and supports the **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policy**. HR owns the overall onboarding program; managers own the role-specific experience.

## Definitions

- **Onboarding**: The process of integrating a new employee into the organization, from offer through the first 90 days.
- **Probationary period**: The first 90 days of employment, during which performance is evaluated at 30, 60, and 90 days.
- **Buddy**: A peer assigned to support a new hire with informal questions and introductions.

## Pre-Start (Before Day 1)

- **Offer and paperwork**: Offer letter and required paperwork (e.g., I-9, W-4, benefits enrollment) are sent at least 2 weeks before start date. Complete and return by the deadline.
- **IT provisioning**: IT provisions accounts, equipment, and access in advance. Equipment is shipped or prepared for pick-up. New hires receive log-in credentials and setup instructions before or on Day 1.
- **Manager preparation**: Hiring manager prepares workspace (or confirms remote setup), first-week schedule, and team introductions. Assigns a buddy.
- **New hire communication**: New hires receive a welcome email with Day 1 details, what to bring, and whom to ask for upon arrival.

## Day 1

- **HR orientation**: Complete any remaining paperwork. Receive employee handbook and policy overview. HR covers benefits, payroll, policies, and resources.
- **IT orientation**: Equipment setup, password and MFA setup, VPN, key systems (email, Slack, HR portal). Report issues to IT immediately.
- **Team introduction**: Introduction to team members and key stakeholders. Tour of facilities (if applicable) or remote-work logistics.
- **Manager meeting**: 1:1 with manager to discuss role, expectations, and first-week priorities.
- **Buddy introduction**: Meet your buddy; they are available for informal questions.

## First Week

- **Daily check-ins**: Manager conducts brief daily check-ins to answer questions and ensure progress.
- **Training**: Complete required training (security awareness, compliance, role-specific). Deadlines are communicated.
- **System access**: Verify access to all needed systems. Escalate gaps to IT and manager.
- **Buddy support**: Buddy available for questions. Use them for "how do I...?" and "who do I ask...?" questions.

## First 30 Days

- **Goals**: Set and document goals for the first 30 days. Review with manager.
- **Training completion**: Complete any remaining compliance training.
- **Cross-functional intro**: Introduction to key cross-functional contacts (e.g., Finance, IT, other teams).
- **30-day check-in**: HR and/or manager conduct a 30-day check-in. Feedback is gathered; adjustments are made as needed.
- **Probationary review**: First probationary review at 30 days. Manager provides feedback on progress.

## First 90 Days

- **Probationary reviews**: Reviews at 30, 60, and 90 days. Manager documents progress and any concerns.
- **90-day review**: Determines successful completion of probation. Feedback is shared; next steps are discussed.
- **Role-specific training**: Complete role-specific training and certifications. Discuss development goals with manager.
- **Integration**: New hire should feel integrated into the team and clear on role and expectations.

## Policy

### Manager Responsibilities

- Own the role-specific onboarding experience.
- Provide clear expectations, feedback, and support.
- Ensure the new hire has the resources and access needed to succeed.
- Address performance issues promptly; involve HR when appropriate.

### New Hire Responsibilities

- Complete paperwork and training on time.
- Ask questions and seek feedback.
- Engage with the buddy and team.
- Communicate any concerns to the manager or HR.

### Accommodations

- New hires with disabilities may request reasonable accommodations. Contact HR to begin the interactive process.
- Accommodations may include equipment, schedule adjustments, or other supports.

## Procedures

### Requesting Accommodations

1. Contact HR as early as possible (e.g., upon offer acceptance).
2. Provide medical or other documentation as requested (HR will specify what is needed).
3. HR will engage in an interactive process to identify reasonable accommodations.
4. Accommodations are implemented before or as soon as possible after Day 1.

### Probationary Extension

- In some cases, probation may be extended to allow more time for assessment or support.
- Extension is documented and communicated to the employee. HR is consulted.

## Examples

**Example 1**: A new hire's laptop has a software issue on Day 1. They contact IT; a temporary solution is provided within hours. The manager adjusts Day 1 expectations accordingly.

**Example 2**: A new hire is unsure how to request time off. They ask their buddy, who directs them to the HR portal. The buddy also shares tips on team norms.

**Example 3**: At the 60-day review, the manager identifies a skill gap. They arrange for additional training and adjust the 90-day goals. The new hire completes probation successfully.

## Enforcement

- Managers who do not adequately onboard new hires may be reviewed. Poor onboarding correlates with retention and performance issues.
- New hires who do not complete required training or paperwork may have access restricted or employment impacted.
